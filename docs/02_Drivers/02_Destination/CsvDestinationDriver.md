Introduction
------------
The `CsvDestinationDriver` writes all results from a migration to a CSV file.

This documentation covers the basics.  If your needs are complicated, see the
documentation for [league/csv](https://csv.thephpleague.com/9.0/) when
configuring the driver.

Usage
-----
No extra configuration is required.

If the destination file
does not exist, it will be created.
